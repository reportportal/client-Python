"""This module includes classes representing RP issues.

Issues are reported within the test item result PUT call. One issue can be
associated with multiple external issues. By external issues is meant issues
at the existing bug tracker systems. The following keys need to be sent in
order to add an issue to the test result:

{
  ...,
  "issue": {
    "autoAnalyzed": true,
    "comment": "string",
    "externalSystemIssues": [

        "submitDate": 0,
